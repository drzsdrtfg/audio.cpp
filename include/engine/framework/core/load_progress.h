// Model-load progress accounting for hosts that stream the trace log
// (audiocpp_server --log-file, audiocpp_cli --log). Mirrors the way
// llama.cpp reports model loading: a bytes-done / bytes-total curve fed
// once per tensor while weights upload, so load UIs get a continuous,
// honest signal instead of a single "loaded" milestone at the end.
//
// Strictly opt-in via --load-progress 1 (default 0): with the flag off,
// no load-progress lines are emitted at all and the log is byte-identical
// to a build without this feature. When enabled alongside --log /
// --log-file, one curve per ModelRegistry::load call; the registry
// brackets it with runtime.load.phase lines and BackendWeightStore::upload
// feeds it:
//
//   [TRACE ...] runtime.load.phase inspect
//   [TRACE ...] runtime.load.phase load
//   [TRACE ...] <store>.weights.upload_progress 0.002
//   ...
//   [TRACE ...] <store>.weights.upload_progress 0.99
//   [TRACE ...] runtime.load.phase loaded
//   [TRACE ...] <store>.weights.upload_progress 1
//
// Thread-safe: a lazy first-use load can overlap an eager load.
